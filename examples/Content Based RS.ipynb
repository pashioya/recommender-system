This process is called **feature extraction** or in this case, simply, vectorization, and is an essential first step toward language-aware analysis. Every plot summary will be transformed from a sequence of words to a point in a **high-dimensional semantic space**. The simplest encoding of semantic space is the **bag-of-words (BOW)** model, another is the tf-idf model.\n","\n","Both models are in fact tables where each row represents a plot summary and each column represents a word and are **count-based**. They count the number of times a word appears in a document and use that as a proxy for the importance of the word in that document. The difference between the two is that the BOW model simply counts the number of times a word appears in a document, while the tf-idf model also takes into account how often the word appears in all documents. The BOW model is a **sparse** representation, meaning that most of the entries in the vector are zero. The tf-idf model is more useful than the BOW model because it **downweights** words that appear frequently in a corpus and are therefore less informative than those that appear rarely.\n","\n"," So, to sum up, every plot summary (or document) will be encoded as a single vector whose length is equal to the size of the vocabulary of all the plot summaries (the so-called corpus) and whose entries are some sort of counts of the words in that summary. This is because most words in the vocabulary do not appear in a given plot summary.\n","\n","We'll use the tf-idf vectorizer to extract features from the plot summaries. The tf-idf vectorizer will transform the plot summaries into a matrix of tf-idf features. The tf-idf vectorizer will **ignore** words that occur in **more than 80%** of the movies and **ignore** words that occur in **less than 2 movies**.
